# Django Rest Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial project available in Django Rest Framework documentation website, in Tutorial session. I've read and implemantaded all the six steps, in sequence: 1- Serialization, 2- Requests and responses, 3- Class based views, 4- Authentication and permissions, 5- Relationships and hyperlinked APIs, and 6- Viewsets and routers; but this last i purposely ignored (the viewset class implementation and router use) once the generic view class was more useful to another project i was doing at same time.
In general, that guide is a good first contact with the documentation of Django Rest Framework and was very helpful to my personal learning, reason why i decided upload him here.

About the system function and usage, is about a basic CRUD of programing code snippets by their respectives owners (users). Each user can CRUD their own snippet, and can also see creations from others. Therefore, an authentication is necessary to do something in DB, but isn't to read only. The users need to be created in the system admin area.
